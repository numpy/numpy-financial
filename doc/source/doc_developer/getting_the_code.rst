Getting the code
================

This document explains how to get the source code for NumPy-Financial using Git.

Code Location
=============

NumPy-Financial is hosted on GitHub. The repository URL is
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-financial.

Creating a fork
===============

To create a fork click the green "fork" button at the top right of the page.
This creates a new repository on your GitHub profile. This will have the URL:
``https://github.com/<your_username>/numpy-financial``.

Cloning the repository
======================

Now that you have forked the repository you will need to clone it. This copies
the repository from GitHub to the local machine. To clone a repository enter the
following commands in the terminal::

    git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/numpy-financial.git

Hooray! You now have a working copy of NumPy-Financial.


Updating the code with other's changes
======================================

From time to time you may want to pull down the latest code. Do this with::

    git fetch

The ``git fetch`` command downloads commits, files and refs from a remote repo
into your local repo.

Then run::

    git merge --ff-only

The ``git merge`` command is Git's way of putting independent branches back
together. The ``--ff-only`` flag tells git to use ``fast-forward`` merges. This
is preferable as fast-forward merge avoids creating merge commits.

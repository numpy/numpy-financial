    What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
    an additional monthly savings of $100.  Assume the interest rate is
    5% (annually) compounded monthly?

    >>> npf.fv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, -100)
    15692.92889433575

    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
    available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
    to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.

    If any input is array_like, returns an array of equal shape.  Let's
    compare different interest rates from the example above.

    Note that computing a monthly mortgage payment is only
    one use for this function.  For example, pmt returns the
    periodic deposit one must make to achieve a specified
    future balance given an initial deposit, a fixed,
    periodically compounded interest rate, and the total
    number of periods.

    Let's compare different interest rates in the example above:

    >>> a = np.array((0.05, 0.04, 0.03))/12
    >>> npf.pv(a, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
    array([ -100.00067132,  -649.26771385, -1273.78633713])

    So, to end up with the same $15692.93 under the same $100 per month
    "savings plan," for annual interest rates of 4% and 3%, one would
    need initial investments of $649.27 and $1273.79, respectively.

    This is the "average" periodically compounded rate of return
    that gives a net present value of 0.0; for a more complete explanation,
    see Notes below.

    :class:`decimal.Decimal` type is not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array_like, shape(N,)
        Input cash flows per time period.  By convention, net "deposits"
        are negative and net "withdrawals" are positive.  Thus, for
        example, at least the first element of `values`, which represents
        the initial investment, will typically be negative.
    guess : float, optional
        Initial guess of the IRR for the iterative solver. If no guess is
        given an heuristic is used to estimate the guess through the ratio of
        positive to negative cash lows
    tol : float, optional
        Required tolerance to accept solution. Default is 1e-12.
    maxiter : int, optional
        Maximum iterations to perform in finding a solution. Default is 100.
    raise_exceptions: bool, optional
        Flag to raise an exception when the irr cannot be computed due to
        either having all cashflows of the same sign (NoRealSolutionException) or
        having reached the maximum number of iterations (IterationsExceededException).
        Set to False as default, thus returning NaNs in the two previous
        cases.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        Internal Rate of Return for periodic input values.

    Notes
    -----
    The IRR is perhaps best understood through an example (illustrated
    using np.irr in the Examples section below). Suppose one invests 100
    units and then makes the following withdrawals at regular (fixed)
    intervals: 39, 59, 55, 20.  Assuming the ending value is 0, one's 100
    unit investment yields 173 units; however, due to the combination of
    compounding and the periodic withdrawals, the "average" rate of return
    is neither simply 0.73/4 nor (1.73)^0.25-1.  Rather, it is the solution
    (for :math:`r`) of the equation:

    .. math:: -100 + \\frac{39}{1+r} + \\frac{59}{(1+r)^2}
     + \\frac{55}{(1+r)^3} + \\frac{20}{(1+r)^4} = 0

    In general, for `values` :math:`= [v_0, v_1, ... v_M]`,
    irr is the solution of the equation: [G]_

    .. math:: \\sum_{t=0}^M{\\frac{v_t}{(1+irr)^{t}}} = 0

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : scalar or array_like shape(K, )
        The discount rate.
    values : array_like, shape(M, ) or shape(M, N)
        The values of the time series of cash flows.  The (fixed) time
        interval between cash flow "events" must be the same as that for
        which `rate` is given (i.e., if `rate` is per year, then precisely
        a year is understood to elapse between each cash flow event).  By
        convention, investments or "deposits" are negative, income or
        "withdrawals" are positive; `values` must begin with the initial
        investment, thus `values[0]` will typically be negative.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float or array shape(K, M)
        The NPV of the input cash flow series `values` at the discount
        `rate`. `out` follows the ufunc convention of returning scalars
        instead of single element arrays.

    Warnings
    --------
    ``npv`` considers a series of cashflows starting in the present (t = 0).
    NPV can also be defined with a series of future cashflows, paid at the
    end, rather than the start, of each period. If future cashflows are used,
    the first cashflow `values[0]` must be zeroed and added to the net
    present value of the future cashflows. This is demonstrated in the
    examples.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import numpy_financial as npf

    Consider a potential project with an initial investment of $40 000 and
    projected cashflows of $5 000, $8 000, $12 000 and $30 000 at the end of
    each period discounted at a rate of 8% per period. To find the project's
    net present value:

    >>> rate, cashflows = 0.08, [-40_000, 5_000, 8_000, 12_000, 30_000]
    >>> np.round(npf.npv(rate, cashflows), 5)
    3065.22267

    It may be preferable to split the projected cashflow into an initial
    investment and expected future cashflows. In this case, the value of
    the initial cashflow is zero and the initial investment is later added
    to the future cashflows net present value:

    >>> initial_cashflow = cashflows[0]
    >>> cashflows[0] = 0
    >>> np.round(npf.npv(rate, cashflows) + initial_cashflow, 5)
    3065.22267

    The NPV calculation may be applied to several ``rates`` and ``cashflows``
    simulatneously. This produces an array of shape
    ``(len(rates), len(cashflows))``.

    >>> rates = [0.00, 0.05, 0.10]
    >>> cashflows = [[-4_000, 500, 800], [-5_000, 600, 900]]

           [-2798.19, -3612.24],
           [-2884.3 , -3710.74]])

    The NPV calculation also supports `decimal.Decimal` types, for example
    if using Decimal ``rates``:

    >>> rates = [Decimal("0.00"), Decimal("0.05"), Decimal("0.10")]
    >>> cashflows = [[-4_000, 500, 800], [-5_000, 600, 900]]

def mirr(values, finance_rate, reinvest_rate, *, raise_exceptions=False):

    Return the Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR).

    MIRR is a financial metric that takes into account both the cost of
    the investment and the return on reinvested cash flows. It is useful
    for evaluating the profitability of an investment with multiple cash
    inflows and outflows.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array_like
        Cash flows, where the first value is considered a sunk cost at time zero.
        It must contain at least one positive and one negative value.
    finance_rate : scalar
        Interest rate paid on the cash flows.
    reinvest_rate : scalar
        Interest rate received on the cash flows upon reinvestment.
    raise_exceptions: bool, optional
        Flag to raise an exception when the MIRR cannot be computed due to
        having all cash flows of the same sign (NoRealSolutionException).
        Set to False as default,thus returning NaNs in the previous case.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        Modified internal rate of return

    Notes
    -----
    The MIRR formula is as follows:

    .. math::

        MIRR = 
        \\left( \\frac{{FV_{positive}}}{{PV_{negative}}} \\right)^{\\frac{{1}}{{n-1}}}
        * (1+r) - 1

    where:
        - \(FV_{positive}\) is the future value of positive cash flows,
        - \(PV_{negative}\) is the present value of negative cash flows,
        - \(n\) is the number of periods.
        - \(r\) is the reinvestment rate.
